This code was made for a RPG called Paranormal Order, it conteins some of the original rules of the actual sistem and some of my own Homebrew.
Its completile custumizable, its a lithe bit difcult if you don't have any html info, but I'll try to simplify it for better use.
On this version it has:

  * Login system;
  * Personal profile;

    COMING SOON

  * Bestiary (from the series and my own creations);
  * World lore info (from the series and my own complements):
  * List of suspects(from the series and my own complements):
